         <h1> The Boy Who Spoke To The Earth <span> by </span> Chris Burkard</h1>

 

<p>Happiness is not a destination, it is a way of seeing.  A little boy sets out to seek happiness. He speaks to the earth, and the earth answers.</p>

<p>&#34Where can I find happiness?&#34 he asks.</p>
<p>&#34Are you willing to make the journey?&#34 the earth responds. 

<p>Thus begins a journey in the grand tradition. The earth sends the little boy to all the most glorious places. Pay close attention to the pictures dear reader. The wonderful opening double&#45spread. And then, as the boy gets on his way, it splits. The left page shows the boy&#39s reaction, the right page gives the earth&#39s advice. Always the boy on the right&#45hand page, just walking on by&#8212sea, cliffs, forest, desert, mountains, the top of the world. Always, the boy walking past, walking, walking. Until the earth falls silent.</p>

<p>&#34So the boy walked and he walked and he walked until he left it all behind.&#34 One circle is complete. The boy has walked through all the glories of the earth, but has not found happiness.</p>
<p>One more time he asks, &#34Earth are you listening?&#34</p>
<p>The earth speaks again. &#34Go back along the trail. But this time, stand still for just a moment.&#34</p>

<p>Dear reader, take a moment to note the alliteration. The little boy &#39waded and wandered&#39, &#39stepped and strode&#39, &#39hiked and hauled&#39, &#39trekked and trudged&#39, and &#39climbed and crawled&#39.</p>

<p>Look at the illustrations again. The same places, now depicted in glorious double&#45page spreads. Because now the little boy is truly looking, and the illustrator needs the double&#45page to depict the vastness of all that he is taking in.</p>

<p>Ah! the shorebirds and the starfish, and the dolphins leaping out of the water. Each illustration depicts the minute details of that place. The sunlight streaming through the trees. The bird riding the thermals.</p>

<p>&#34And for the first time the boy truly saw….&#34</p>
<p>And in this seeing he finds the happiness he was seeking.</p>

<p>&#34Happiness was all around him.&#34 A most satisfying ending.</p> 
<p>A book that I’d recommend to children and adults alike. </p>
