                    <h3>The Unvarnished Truth</h3>

                    <p>Truth trudged sadly down the road. His shoulders sagged, a frown creased his brow. Multi-hued
                        fable danced by his side.</p>

                    <p>&#34Why is it,&#34 truth asked his friend, &#34that people don’t listen to me? We say the same
                        things — you and I.&#34</p>

                    <p>&#34Let me tell you a story,&#34 replied fable.</p>

                    <p>A man was walking down a road. It was a warm and balmy day, but the man had a jacket on. The wind
                        whistled as it blew past him.</p>

                    <p>&#34Look at that human in a thick woolen jacket,&#34 he said to the sun. &#34I&#39m sure I can
                        get him to take it off.&#34</p>

                    <p>The sun smiled.</p>

                    <p>The wind roared past the man. Whoosh. Whoosh. It gathered strength as it blew in from all
                        directions. However, the louder the wind roared the more the man clutched his jacket to himself.
                        Soon the wind grew tired.</p>

                    <p>&#34I give up,&#34 he said. &#34Some people will never learn. You try, sun.&#34</p>

                    <p>It was a warm and balmy day. The man whistled as he walked. &#34The day seems to be made of
                        gold,&#34 he said to himself.</p>

                    <p>The sun shone a little warmer. A few beads of sweat formed on the man’s brow but he wiped them
                        off. The sun grew hotter. The man looked around. The heat was now uncomfortable and the jacket
                        just made things worse. He took it off, folded it over his arm.</p>

                    <p>The sun smiled.</p>

                    <p>&#34And that&#34, said fable, &#34is what I do. Take your bare words and dress them up in all the
                        colors of the rainbow. I am the suggestion, not the force. I am the spoonful of sugar that makes
                        the medicine go down. I am the honey…&#34</p>

                    <p>&#34Enough,” replied truth. “You are the costume I don in the world of men.&#34</p>
