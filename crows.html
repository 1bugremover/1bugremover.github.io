         <h1>Counting Crows<span> by </span>Kathy Appelt </h1>

<p>Can Math and whimsy go together in a book? Yes, if the book is Counting Crows by Kathy Appelt. Noisy crows, hungry crows, fashionable crows gather in threes (do you get the math reference?)</p>

<p>These crows are doing what crows do: swinging from the branches, building nests, resting on the power lines that dot a landscape, and they are doing all this in threes. Safety in numbers? Or a reminder that crows are social creatures. Their large communal roosts often number in the thousands.</p>

<p>Why did the author choose crows over other birds? Alliteration apart, it could also be a nod to the commonly held belief that crows have &#39number sense&#39. There is the story of a farmer bothered by a crow eating his crop. Before he could get the crow the clever bird flew away. &#34Ah ha,&#34 thought the farmer, &#34I&#39ll get you crow.&#34 He instructed two hunters to hide in a hut, and only one of them to make a noisy exit. The bird was not fooled. Two had gone in, only one had come out. The farmer kept increasing the number of hunters but the crow always figured that the number of hunters leaving was one less than the number in the hut. In this particular version of the story (https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dehaene-number.html) the crow counted correctly up to four, but was defeated when five hunters hid in the hut. Scientists are still debating whether this is pattern recognition, or a true number sense.</p>

<p>But back to the book, and the author&#39s sly incorporation of numbers and counting. Not only does the reader count the crows but also the snacks that the birds are chomping on. From three roly poly bugs and three mangoes to six salty peanuts and six plums, and so on and on. Till we reach the number nine. Then the number goes up by one: so ten, eleven and then twelve. There it stops. A round dozen crows: they caw and cackle, eat and grackle. Until&#46&#46&#46into this paradise danger arrives in the form of a cat&#45just one cat who counts the twelve crow tails and dreams of a feast.</p>

<p>Three-by-three the crows leave the tree. Aloha, adios and goodbye. One dozen counting crows take to the sky. One cat on the bench says &#34Bye, crows, bye!&#34</p>

<p>The words tell the story, pictures embellish it. Robert Dunlavey is the kind of illustrator you hope would illustrate your book (when you write one). How can you illustrate such a simple story effectively? Well, look at the book. The illustrator chooses just a three-color palette: white, black and red on a clean white page. The stylised crows stand out, but wait. There is style on style: red and white striped shirts on all but one crow. He&#45the fashion maven&#45adorns his neck with a polka-dot scarf!</p>

<p>Counting the snacks is almost a game in itself, for the illustrator creates double&#45page spreads and spreads the food across both pages. And ends the book with a gift to the hungry cat who could not catch a crow: the wonderful red polka-dot scarf now adorns her neck.</p>

<p>A wonderful cross-subject book that all young readers will enjoy.</p>
