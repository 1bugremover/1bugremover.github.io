      <h1>A Brave Bear<span> by</span> Sean Taylor</h1>



<p>Goldilocks and The Three Bears. Winnie-the Pooh. Paddington Bear. Bears are part of our psyche. Now along comes a new bear story: A Brave Bear.</p>

<p>“The sun was hot,” begins the story. &#34The air was hot.&#34</p>

<p>&#34I think a pair of hot bears is probably the hottest thing in the world,&#34 says Dad, and the story takes off. Little Bear thinks UP a good idea to go to the river and cool DOWN. Simple words, so descriptive.</p> 
<p>&#34The grassy part to go ACROSS.&#34</p>
 <p>&#34The bushy part to PUSH THROUGH.&#34</p>

<p>&#34I think a jumping bear is probably the jumpiest thing in the world,&#34 says Little Bear. Do you see, reader, a repeat of the sentence structure, almost, but not quite a chorus.</p> 

<p>We have reached the pinnacle of the story. Little Bear jumps—&#34I wanted him to see me do a big jump&#34—and falls. Oh, oh. How does the story resolve? Dad offers to carry Little Bear, but he is determined to show Dad: &#34I decided to go on my own.&#34</p>

<p>&#34I think a brave bear is probably the bravest thing in the world,&#34 says Dad.</p>

<p>And the wonderful illustrations: it's a simple palette yet so alive. Dad fully attentive to his son. Little Bear marching ahead, Dad looking back, keeping a wary eye on the surroundings. He is responsible for Little Bear. You can read the story of their relationship in those wonderfully expressive eyes.</p> 

<p>They make it to the river finally. Look at that two-page spread reader. Dad and son blissfully floating on the cool river-water.</p> 

<p>&#34I think a pair of wet bears is probably the wettest thing in the world,&#34 says Little Bear.</p>

<p>The day has turned around.

<p>&#34On the way home the sun was glowing. The air was glowing….&#34</p>

<p>&#34Even tomorrow was glowing.&#34</p>

<p>The first picture had Dad and Little Bear in a cave, trying to keep cool. The last illustration, also a circle, has them walking confidently into that yellow-orange sky.</p>

<p>Could there be a more positive ending to a story?</p>
