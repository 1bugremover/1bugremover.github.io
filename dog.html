      <h1>Dog in Charge<span> by</span> K.L. Going</h1>



<p>Have you ever been left in charge of something, anything? Cats? dogs, babies, the home? Not an easy job, let me tell you. When the cat is away the mice will play, and even the simplest of things can end up becoming a huge gigantic mess. Now imagine what happens when dog is left in charge of one, two, three, four, five cats.</p>

<p>Dog is a sweetheart. A gentle soul. Dan Santat&#39s illustrations show us dog in all his glory. &#34Dog had a busy day&#34, says the first page. We see this huge mastiff, his size alone would scare away robbers,  dressed in a tutu. A tutu! And his mistress is tying a bow. He sits, stays, dances as his mistress asks. Dog follows all commands faithfully. We know now that Dog is a pushover. And he is going to be in charge of five cats? Yikes.</p>

</p>Dog sees the humans leave, and the cats on the couch lined up in a row. &#34First we will sit and then we will stay,&#34 Dog thinks, expecting the same behavior from the cats as he displays to the humans. Is he in for a surprise. Suddenly the pictures are filled with activity: cats running, jumping, hiding, dog chasing, searching, searching. He goes from room to room to bathroom. No cat, no cat, no cat, till cats jump out and from their hiding places and skedaddle. Disaster follows. Dog is tired. This taking charge is exhausting business. Will the family still love him and give him treats? Dog wonders.</p>

<p>There is Dog stretched out across a two&#45page spread, thinking. Idea strikes, his ears perk up. Surely cats would come for the treats? the four panels on the next page show us what happens. &#34Poor Dog!&#34 Tired and sated he falls asleep. Time for the cats to appear. They love Dog, did not mean him any harm. One, two, three, four, five cats set the house in order again. The family returns to this perfect home, dog in charge and the cats fast asleep.</p>

<p>&#34Good Dog,&#34 say his mistress.</p>

<p>&#34Good cats,&#34 thought Dog. &#34Smart cats. The very best cats.&#34</p>

<p>Only the reader know the truth behind the story!</p>
