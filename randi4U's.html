<h3><span> Getting a Publisher to Say Yes</span><i> by </i>Randi Lynn Mrvos</h3>


 <p>You&#39ve written a picture book that you&#39d like to get published. So, how do you get an editor to say yes to your work?</p> 

 <p>I&#39m the editor of Kid&#39s Imagination Train ezine. For many years, my manuscripts were passed over by book publishers. Because I desperately wanted to get a picture book published, I attended writer&#39s workshops and conferences, took writing classes, and read books on the craft of writing for children in order to grow as a writer. My manuscripts won awards; but sadly, publishers still said no thanks.</p> 
 
 <p>I was disappointed, but became even more determined. The rejections prompted me to find out how other children&#39s book writers got their works published. And this led me to the library. I analyzed several picture books. Then I focused on one of my favorites, <i>Mr. Tiger Goes Wild</i> by Peter Brown. What was it about this award&#45winning book that made it special, <i>publishable</i>? After studying the story, the answer became apparent. It had the four U&#39s: a unique character, a unique quest, a unique voice and a unique resolution.</p>

 <p>The protagonist, Mr. Tiger, is unique because he has a special want, a great need. This need sets him on a unique quest that only he can take, and in turn change and grow. The quest is fraught with problems. The prospect of unfulfillment creates an emotional impact that makes the audience care about this character.</p>

 <p>I also discovered that the book has a unique voice&#8212that intangible element of a story which creates mood. It&#39s the special way words come together to tell the story. It&#39s the song of the story. And finally, the conclusion of this story has a twist and ends in a unique and satisfying way.</p>

 <p>Amazed and excited about this finding, I pulled out my favorite (and 50 times-rejected) manuscript, <i>Maggie and the Summer Vacation Show&#45and&#45Tell</i>. Maggie had a unique character and a unique voice. It did however, lack a unique quest and a unique resolution. After getting into Maggie&#39s head, I figured out her personal journey and created a surprise ending. The manuscript was then submitted to five publishers. Within three weeks, Cactus Moon Publications expressed interest in publishing the story.</p> 

 <p>My dream of publishing a children&#39s book became a reality. Now, I&#39m convinced that a unique character, a unique quest, a unique voice and a unique resolution made all the difference. These four elements elicited the aww factor publishers are striving to find. When you apply the 4 U&#39s to your stories, a publisher may say yes to your work.</p>
