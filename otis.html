      <h1>When Otis Courted Mama<span> by</span> Kathi Appelt</h1>



<p>Don&#39t we all love stories with a twist. And what fun if the twist comes early on&#45we think we know where the story is going and boom, it takes a completely different direction. Kathy Appelt starts the story with, what we realize later, is a misdirection. &#34Before Otis, Cardell had a mostly wonderful life.&#34</p> 

<p>All right then. Otis, whoever he is, is the bad guy, because he ruined the wonderful life that Cardell had. &#34He had a perfectly good mama and a perfectly good daddy.&#34 Already we are starting to dislike Otis. How dare he come and disrupt a perfectly happy family? Cardell&#39s perfectly good mama and his perfectly good daddy adored him. Stands to reason they adored each other too.</p>

<p>Perfectly good daddy did so many fun things with Cardell&#45&#45cooking, playing, singing. Life was good. Wait a minute though. &#34The only problem was that Cardell&#39s perfectly good daddy lived in a different part of the desert.&#34 What? Mama and Daddy lived apart? Yes, and when he went visiting his daddy he had to share time with his stepmama and stepbrother. When he lived with Mama, which was most of the time, &#34he had his perfectly good mama all to himself.&#34</p>

<p>So the story problem is set up and defined. Cardell lives with mama&#45&#45a champion scout and master artist, with a smile that makes even the planets glow.&#34Yep, apart from a few sticker burs and occasional sand fleas, Cardell&#39s life was mostly wonderful.&#34 Into this steps Otis&#45&#45not the first coyote to come romancing mama, mind. But, importantly, mama hadn&#39t liked those who came before Otis. Otis was different. Cordell waited, and waited for mama to send him away, too. &#34But adios Otis never came.&#34 Grr.</p> 

<p>It never came because Otis was different. He cared. He made cactus pudding with Cardell. He showed Cardell what a terrific pouncer he was. You see, he cared for Cardell and mama, but in his own way. He was not there to replace perfectly good dad. One night mama and Otis and Cardell sat around the bonfire and Otis shared the funniest stories ever. As he left he shook paws with Cardell, coyote to coyote.</p> 

<p>&#34A few moons later, Otis asked Mama to marry him.&#34 Now Cardell waited, along with Otis, eager for mama to say yes. Mama took her own sweet time replying. Finally she says it&#45&#45&#34Yes&#34. Yes! Besides his perfectly good family Cardell now has Otis. As the illustrations show. The first spread shows Cardell with perfectly good Mama and perfectly good Daddy. The almost last spread has Cardell with Mama and Otis. Followed by a picture of the blended family. The illustrations march hand in hand with the words, enhancing them&#58 Cardell&#39s eagerness, his boredom, his Grr! And always the desert in the background, faithfully depicted with browns and yellows and orange.</p> 

<p>The story comes full circle, to a most satisfying ending. &#34And life? Sticker burs and sand fleas aside, it was mostly wonderful.&#34</p>
 
<p>As it is to the reader, a mostly wonderful book.</p>
