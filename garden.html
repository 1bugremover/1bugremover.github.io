      <h1>The Magical Garden of Claude Monet<span> by</span> Laurence Anholt</h1>


<p>Beauty twice over. The beauty of the subject, and the beauty of the writing. Laurence Anholt, a gifted painter in his own right, has created a series of books on the great European painters. Each story is delicately told; the reader is transported to the world the painter lived in&#45a different time, almost a different space. Each story has its base in a true incident on the painter&#39s life. Anholt takes off from there, takes us into a world we may not have known about.</p>

<p>Monet painted gardens and bridges and haystacks. Most of them were painted in the Giverny, the magical garden that young Julie visits, and that we get to visit through the story. Anholt&#39s illustrations do justice to the subject. The full&#45page spread with just a sentence fragment faithfully captures the colors of the French countryside.</p> 

<p>Julie&#39s dog Louey gets away from her, running &#34down the hill and into a lane where a huge wall stood around a mysterious garden.&#34 Through the break in the gate she follows Louey, straight into this &#34dreamy world&#34&#45&#45the magical garden of Claude Monet. As Julie had followed her dog, we follow her, through the garden, the pond where the water lilies grow, the bridge, all of which Monet has recreated in his paintings. Anholt&#39s illustrations take us into that wonderful world.</p>

<p>We hear about his fading eyesight and are saddened, for what is more important to a painter than the ability to see? Young Julie reminds him of his own philosophy&#58 &#34You will need to be very patient, like a gardner.&#34</p>

<p>The back matter tells us of Monet &#34insisting that the house run like clockwork.&#34 It takes just one sentence in the story to reveal that facet of his being. &#34Six o&#39clock precisely,&#34 he said. &#34Time to eat.&#34</p>

<p>With sparse words and wonderful pictures the author  paints a picture of a great artist.</p>
