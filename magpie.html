      <h1>The Magpie Song<span> by</span> Laurence Anholt</h1>



<p>City lights, country lights. The old and the young. Grandpa and granddaughter. The Magpie Song is a study in contrasts, but it so much more. It is a story of how people can connect despite the difference in time and place and age and interest&#45surely bring succor to the older generation that feels they have been so left behind in this technological advancement that there is no way they can connect with their grandchildren.</p> 

<p>How often have you heard them say, &#34My grandchildren will get bored in my company.&#34 Here is a story that shows them differently. Isn&#39t it strange that books &#34written for children&#34 carry messages that reverberate across generations? This is one such book.</p>

<p>The first spread shows Carla looking out the window at the &#34million orange lights below&#34 because she can&#39t sleep. Her letter to grandpa describes that, and all the sounds of the city. She asks him about the country. &#34Will you write to me someday?&#34</p>

<p>Grandpa replies. Sometimes he can&#39t sleep either, but its not the noise rather the silence that keeps him awake. &#34When my eyes get used to the dark, I see the whole sky is full of stars.&#34 Noise and silence. City light, country lights. Same but different.</p>

<p>Now Carla and grandpa correspond regularly. Carla shares her school problems, grandpa offers comfort and advice.  &#34If the work you do at school is like the letters you write to me, then you must be smart.&#34 &#34Everyone can do something well.&#34</p>

<p>The author draws beautiful analogies. &#34The wood&#46&#46&#46as white as the pages of a book. They tell you the whole story of the night before, if you know how to read them.&#34 What a very descriptive sentence. Whenever I step into the woods now, I&#39ll remember to read them, as trackers do, and naturalists and researchers.</p>
